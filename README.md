Disaster Management

Webapp to manage natural disasters better

Features:
(a)Twitter Stream data analysis to coordinate response and relief.
(b)Twitter Stream data analysis to pinpoint the location of disaster.
(c)Automated suggestions of healthcare centres/police stations to triage relief from.

The app has two parts:
Part I : It will display nearby healthcare centres/police stations from the person accessing the app. It will help the user to direct himself to a safe location in the mayhem of destruction.
Part II :The other part will keep analysing twitter stream data to find if there are a lot of tweets regarding a natural calamity and with sentimental analysis find if the tweets indicate that something bad is happening.It will also give the location of the calamity which will help the people to stay away from that area and the authorities to know where to rescue from.

The app is an idea to help people during the time of crisis and use the thousands of eye witnesses to the calamity as source of information to the authorities as well as helping those affected by it.

Future work on the app will focus on determining exact location of affected location and their intensity so that the authorities can facilitate rescue operations in a better way.It will also not only tell about the nearby hospitals but also direct towards them while guiding away from the epicenter of the calamity.
